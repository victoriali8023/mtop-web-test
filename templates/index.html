    <h3>Study title: Glanceable Feedback Performance on Smartwatch</h3>

    <p><Strong>Researchers: </Strong> Mark Newman, Pedja Klasnja, Yuxuan Li <br>
    We’re inviting you to take a test for research. There are no negative consequences if you don’t want to take it. <br>
    If you start the survey, you can always change your mind and stop at any time.</p>
    

    <p><Strong>What is the purpose of this study?</Strong> We want to learn how factors (i.e. salience, granularity, and stylization) affect the performance of the smartwatch display.</p>
    

    <p><Strong>What will I do?</Strong> This test will let you play game three times and ask questions about smartwatch interface, like what is the current progress and what is the current time. The test will take about 20 minutes.</p>
    

    <p><Strong>Risks:</Strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will give you the code for you to fill in Amazon Mechnical Turk at the end of the study. Make sure you have read Amazon’s MTurk participant and privacy agreements to understand how your personal information may be used or disclosed.
    Breach of confidentiality: There is a chance your data could be seen by someone who shouldn’t have access to it. We’re minimizing this risk in the following ways:
    Data is anonymous. </li>
      <li>We’ll store all electronic data on a password-protected, encrypted computer. </li>
      <li>We’ll keep your identifying information separate from your research data, but we will be able to link it to you. We’ll destroy this link after we finish collecting and analyzing the data.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p><Strong>Future research: </Strong>De-identified data (all identifying information removed) may be shared with other researchers. You won’t be told specific details about these future research studies.</p> 

    <p><Strong>Where will data be stored? </Strong>On the servers for the online database software (Heroku).</p> 

    <p><Strong>How long will it be kept? </Strong>6 months</p> 

    <p><Strong>Who can see my data?</Strong></p>
